# The Study Planner

I have created this repo to organize the topics, tutorials, courses and books that I study or intend to study. I will try update this repo twice a week or at least once per week.   

## Creation of Repo : 30-09-18

As of now, I am trying to maintain between my undergrad studies and keeping up with relevant topics of recent technology. I hope to a good balance between them.

* [Machine Learning - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) - Andrew Ng

I have always been fascinated by machine learning and its potential applications in various domains. Moreover, I needed to delve into this field for the ongoing computer vision project, so finally here we are. This course was recommended by various sources and after previewing some of the videos, I found the content to be good. Therefore, I take up this course to learn about the theoretical aspects of machine learning.

* [Machine Learning A-Z - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/) - Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves

The ML course by Andrew Ng is based on the theoretical aspects and uses MATLAB/Octave for its exercises. Although good for analysing algorithms, these languages are not used in practical projects. This udemy course takes a more practical approach by using R and Python and teaching to apply ML algorithms on real-life datasets. This course doesn't go too deep in analysing the algorithms though.

* [Digital Circuits - NPTEL Course](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc18_ee33/preview) - Dr. Santanu Chattopadhyay

I always wanted to learn more about digital electronics as to how a computer works through all the boolean logic of 1s and 0s. So I decided to take on this 12-week course. It comprises of weekly assignment submission along with a final in-person examination with a mark weightage of 25:75 for total marks evaluation.

Examination: **28th October, 2018**
