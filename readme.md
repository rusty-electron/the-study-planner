# The Study Planner

I have created this repo to organize the topics, tutorials, courses and books that I study or intend to study. I will try update this repo twice a week or at least once per week.   

## Creation of Repo : 30-09-18

As of now, I am trying to maintain between my undergrad studies and keeping up with relevant topics of recent technology. I hope to a good balance between them.

**Ongoing Stuff :**

*Courses:*

* [Digital Circuits - NPTEL Course](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc18_ee33/preview) - Dr. Santanu Chattopadhyay

I always wanted to learn more about digital electronics as to how a computer works through all the boolean logic of 1s and 0s. So I decided to take on this 12-week course. It comprises of weekly assignment submission along with a final in-person examination with a mark weightage of 25:75 for total marks evaluation.

Examination: **28th October, 2018**
