## Sorry for the Gap
*Durga Puja holiday's are in and therefore I may not be able to make additions to this repo for some time but I'll try whenever I can.*

## 19-10-18:

1. Digital Circuits - Week 12

    We are now at the last week of this NPTEL course. Hall Tickets have arrived and its time to revise the 12-weeks of content in these few days.

    * Microprocessors
        * Instructions
        * Address Bus & Data Bus

2. Computer Vision - Udacity

    I was able to complete `Lesson 6 - 2D Gradients` today. But I am still lagging by *three lessons* according to the timeline. 

    * **Topics Covered:**
        * Canny Edge Detector
        * Laplacian Operator for Edge Detection
        * MATLAB Implementations

3. Realizing the potential benefit of learning Javascript and its Frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, etc. I plan to devote time to get a good grasp on VanillaJS and then resort to learning one of the framework to the extent *(of being to apply to real-life projects)*. I plan to execute this plan once the *Digital Circuits examinations* are over.
Steps involved shall be:
    * Learn good amount of VanillaJS

        I think I have some courses lying in my portable hard drives, need to check those.

    * Complete JS Stuff in freecodecamp.com
    * Review content of *'Engineer Man Node Basics Playlist'*
