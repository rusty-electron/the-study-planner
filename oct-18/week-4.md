*Back to College Campus* 

1. Digital Circuits - Microprocessors : Certification Exam tomorrow

# 28-01-18

*Done with Digital Circuits Course*. But, I still think that I haven't grasped all the topics taught in the lectures so I plan to watch them again to brush up the concepts.

The end of the course has cleared up a spot on my course schedule so I plan to fill it up soon with something else.
