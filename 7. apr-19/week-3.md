During the Bihu holidays I haven't been up to much - I took the SIM800 RS232 Modem home to begin testing but due to the lack of debugging tools, I couldn't get it to work. I plan on working on it again soon.

I was able to complete the MP Assignment during the last few days of the vacation and it worked out well. I was able to implement a decent algorithm in 8085 Assembly and It has been submitted. This reminds me that I will have to begin working on the second assignment soon.

So, today as the exam date for the NPTEL MP and MC course - It went well considering the minimal amount of pre-exam preparation put into it. I hope to get a percentage of 80+.
