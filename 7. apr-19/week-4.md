During the Bihu holidays I haven't been up to much - I took the SIM800 RS232 Modem home to begin testing but due to the lack of debugging tools, I couldn't get it to work. I plan on working on it again soon.

I was able to complete the MP Assignment during the last few days of the vacation and it worked out well. I was able to implement a decent algorithm in 8085 Assembly and It has been submitted. This reminds me that I will have to begin working on the second assignment soon.

So, today as the exam date for the NPTEL MP and MC course - It went well considering the minimal amount of pre-exam preparation put into it. I hope to get a percentage of 80+.

The course content (both books and videos) have arrived and the closed group for the course subcribers is now quite active. So, it is now high time for me to begin serious preparation for the GATE Exams. First of all, I plan to take along the prep for GATE by starting to study the subjects - Signals & Systems and Network Theory. As the NPTEL course is now over, I should be able to devote time into this cause now.
