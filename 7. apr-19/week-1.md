Watched 3 videos of ARM lectures from NPTEL Week 9, although I am lagging behind by a few videos, I feel that I can make it in time to Week 10.

I was able to workout the location dropdown feature for WeatherBox App and it works well, but now I have found some bugs after the added features (related to multiple event listeners for the same action), I hope to be able to fix it soon.
