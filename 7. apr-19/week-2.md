Submitted Week-10 of NPTEL today with 100% score. During the study of the lectures for this week, I was able to get a good idea about IIC (Inter Integrated Circuit) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), hope to learn more about these soon. 

I have been given the task of preparing a Payment Interface using the module GSM 800 by Dr. Durlav Sir. I plan to start working on it soon and finish it before the end of Bihu holidays.
