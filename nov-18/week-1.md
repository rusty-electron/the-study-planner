## November, 2018

The semester examinations are going to be held around the end of this month so most of the study this month will be mainly college curriculum. Even then I shall try my best to offer time to my side-projects.

1. Computer Vision - Week-6 completed

    Topics studied:  

    * MATLAB implementation of hough transfrom
    * Hough transform of real-life images
    * Impact of noise on hough transfrom
    * Extensions of hough transfrom

    The next two lessons are also on hough transfrom so I plan to complete them within this week.
