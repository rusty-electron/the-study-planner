Ok, I need to admit that I have been not posting updates here for long, ever since the commencement of sixth semester exams. Not just updates, i have also not been pushing code on to github.

Anyways, I will now be fixing this and continue to post updates here. Post exam I completed my IOCL internship and then was even able to land an internship at IIIT with Manpa and Joy. This time the three of us shall be working on a Computer Vision algorithm to detect the engagement of online and classroom learners. 

I started working on NoobBot v1.0 and the body is completed. I now only need to work on the remote controller. This should be over in about a week. I have also made great progress on the SPS paper and after a few checks, it should be ready to be sent for publishing.
