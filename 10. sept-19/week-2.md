Introduction to Biostatistics - Progress not going very well, the lectures are not good and fail to teach statistics. Luckily, I have found some good videos on the topics on KhanAcademy.

Final Year Project - I have set up the s/w on Raspberry Pi 3 and tried running Haar Cascades with decent results. I have ordered two medium-sized servo motors along with a 16-channel servo controller today, once these arrive we shall start working on the turret.

Internship Project - On halt, unable to manage time for it. Pending a visit to IIIT.

Paper Progress - Updates on IIIT visit. Still trying to find time and will to review the final draft.
