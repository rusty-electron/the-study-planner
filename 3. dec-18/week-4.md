I have added the feature to the smart parking system project that works on counting magnetometer triggers based on a time period and the ratio of triggers to total runs counted within that period. The previous method simply counted the number of consecutive triggers and it failed in some cases.

Other than that I have submitted the product landing project for FCC Frontend Certification. One more to go.

I have submitted the product landing and technical documentation page. All that remains now are the type-and-learn lessons.
