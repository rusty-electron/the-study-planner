First of all, I am really sorry for not being able to git these few days but I wasn't able to make time for it due to the ongoing semester examination. As of now, three out of six subject evaluation is completed and there is a gap of about a week till the rest of the subject's examination.

### Recent Stuff

* KWoC '18 is here. I have registered for it. The coding period is from 5th December to 7th January. I hope that I shall be able to contribute to the project to a good extent.

Brushed up my linux-lingo by working on setting up a Ubuntu VM and testing my YT-mp3 download script on linux-ecosystem. On testing, I found issues regarding path directory and folder-write permission. I was able fix it after poking around for sometime.

Aftermath: The console-app is now linux-compatible! although it didn't require much tweaking.

Today, I planned to work on the KWoC thing and tried to have a look at all the project involved, was dazzled at the sheer quantity btw the page descriptions on main-site don't quite provide a very good explanation regarding the repo and I had to visit the github page readme to figure out what it actually was. 

As I realized it was not possible to go through all of them, I settled after looking into 20 of them. The ones I choose are rather simple and based mostly on python scripting, webscraping and flask. 

The projects I plan to work on are:
    
* [add cover art](https://github.com/piyush27ranjan/Add-cover-art)
* [facebook-archive](https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/facebook-archive)
* [artemis-arrow](https://github.com/thelethalcode/Artemis-arrow)
