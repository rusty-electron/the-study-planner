The semester exams ended on 15th and the postponed practical examinations ended on  17th, since then I have been taking sometime off as a break and that's why didn't update this blog. As of now, I am going to get back to working on KWoC and to adding entries to the snippet blog.

Not much done today. Started learning about flask via a medium article. BTW I plan to keep a blog for tracking the articles that I have read from any source say digit mag or medium.
