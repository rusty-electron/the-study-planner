The semester exams ended on 15th and the postponed practical examinations ended on  17th, since then I have been taking sometime off as a break and that's why didn't update this blog. As of now, I am going to get back to working on KWoC and to adding entries to the snippet blog.

Not much done today. Started learning about flask via a medium article. BTW I plan to keep a blog for tracking the articles that I have read from any source say digit mag or medium.

Today, I worked on the data visualisation aspect of our branch's economics project. The report is almost complete and only some finalization remains to be done. Worked on the snippet blog and maybe I will start on some reverse engineering of binary files.
