Today, I haven't studied much as I was invited to a friend's home for lunch so I along with my other friends spent the day there. Yet towards the evening, I was able to study for a few hours. 

1. Computer Vision
    * Sobel and other operators for finding Image gradient.
    * MATLAB code to find image gradient magnitude and its direction. 
    
    I still need to write the condition for finding pixels with direction orientation of `-180/180 deg`.
    * Obstacles in finding image gradient
