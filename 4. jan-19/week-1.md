Alright, the new year is here and with it I have started learning Flask via the video tutorials by sentdex, All his videos date back to 2015 but I think the core syntaxes have not changed much. He uses bootstrap as the frontend framework but I guess one can skip that if one wishes and continue with the backend.

So these few days I have been quite busy, I made six pull requests out of which five have been merged while one remains pending. In a few hours, the event will end so I guess, in total I have made five PRs. I am happy with it as I have learnt a lot during the contribution period, specially I have developed a love for open source. I guess this is indeed the motive of such events, to put into focus the power of open source software. Anyways, the main things that I learnt are:

* more about github workflow
* tkinter and its root in unix
* practised a good lot of frontend design
* better ways of documenting code

With all that I have learnt in KWoC'18, I hope I can do well in hosting BitOverflow this month (lot of work to do). BTW I plan on being a mentor next year so I hope I will be able to earn my worth to be called as a mentor.

Also I have been doing lots of design work since I learnt the Photoshop Basics course on skillshare. I am done with the tri-fold brochure but the work for event flyers is still left.

I promise to give my best in organising Techxom '19.
