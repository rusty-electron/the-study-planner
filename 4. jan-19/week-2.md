So, I am done with the flyer for BitOverflow and it looks pretty good. The NPTEL Course on Microprocessors and Microcontrollers is open now so I will have to start working on it too. As I am now aware how weeks of content may stack up as pending so I want to have a headstart this time.

Also, I have begun working on the flowchart that I plan to present for the IIIT Project.
