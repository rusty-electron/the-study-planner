Today is the submission date for the end-term report for KWoC '18. I have written the report in the form of a blog and one can find it [here][1]. The report writing experience was nice and enjoyable.

The Hacktoberfest T-shirt is here along with some nice stickers. I worked on a flask CRUD app and soon I plan on making an attendance tracker.

I will be going back to college campus tomorrow and this will mark the beginning of the sixth semester of my degree.
