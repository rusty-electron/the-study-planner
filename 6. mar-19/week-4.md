The 8th Week of the NPTEL course is going on and it is now going to handle the ARM architecture. I have created the repo for the weather-box and the initial bugs have been worked out, commits will be added soon.

I have sent some suggestions for the "Ami Porhim" initiative regarding the content and direction of the tutorials. The GATE materials have been delayed and they will be arriving in April.
