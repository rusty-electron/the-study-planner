Okay, Things have been going on well. I am currently on the 4th Week into the NPTEL Microprocessors course, my progress is in sync with the curriculum taught at college. I have to work on the Full-Adder circuit that I am designing (the second bit is buggy). As for the Coding Club page, I have submitted a rough sketch of the site layout and will start working on it soon.

I also have to do some searching on drone applications for the indiainnovates thing. This reminds me that I need to prepare a decent demo for the progress (non-existent) on the Computer Vision Research. Well, on the bright side I was able to get a good grasp on the working principle of OpAmps.

Also I want to state that:
* Habitica is great
* OTE Test tommorow
