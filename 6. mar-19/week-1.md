Okay, things have been going on well. I am currently on the 4th Week into the NPTEL Microprocessors course, my progress is in sync with the curriculum taught at college. I have to work on the Full-Adder circuit that I am designing (the second bit is buggy). As for the Coding Club page, I have submitted a rough sketch of the site layout and will start working on it soon.

I also have to do some searching on drone applications for the indiainnovates thing. This reminds me that I need to prepare a decent demo for the progress (non-existent) on the Computer Vision Research. Well, on the bright side I was able to get a good grasp on the working principle of OpAmps.

Also I want to state that:
* Habitica is great
* OTE Test tommorow

After doing some reading on drone applications, I went ahead and discussed with Vishal regarding the project guidelines mentioned in the FAQs section of the host site. The meeting went great and we plan to meet again after some more reading on the topics along with other members of the team.

The OTE test was decent as the question paper set that I had to solve was comparatively easy. Also, today I checked the procedure to operate a 8085 uP kit via a video tutorial and Simulation App.
