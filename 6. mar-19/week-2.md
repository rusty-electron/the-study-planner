Today was the first day of the IoT workshop for our branch, it consisted of lectures on IoT Theory, the lectures were a bit bland as expected (but it was a win-win as for the free internet at Computer Centre, decent breakfast and Non-veg Lunch) and finally, an escape from two days of classes). The second part of the session will be held tomorrow, according to the brochure it will be a hands-on workshop.

The Timed Charger (idea initiated in mid-2018) project is almost done, as of now I want to work on the Li-Po battery and some addition features like deep sleep mode and a better web UI.

NPTEL Week 7 submission tomorrow and I also need to prepare for the flipped classroom topic for Signals & System.
