## Mid-November

I almost forgot to post that the results for the Digital circuits course have been published and I am glad that I was able to achieve an *Elite* [certificate](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z_xSVr9-dTuqAc6KFNAbjA6qyk-TNj8W) with a total score of 73 :sparkles: .

Quite happy that I was able to have decent despite my chaotic preparation.

## End-November

The Winter courses of NPTEL have been announced and I have enrolled for the course [*Microprocessors and Microcontrollers*](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc19_ee11) that is mentored by the same professor Dr. Santanu Chattopadhay.

BTW a course of the same syllabus is also in our 6th semester course so I guess It will good for my academics as well.
