## November, 2018

The semester examinations are going to be held around the end of this month so most of the study this month will be mainly college curriculum. Even then I shall try my best to offer time to my side-projects.

### 03-11-2018

1. Computer Vision - Week-6 completed

    Topics studied:  

    * MATLAB implementation of hough transfrom
    * Hough transform of real-life images
    * Impact of noise on hough transfrom
    * Extensions of hough transfrom

    The next two lessons are also on hough transfrom so I plan to complete them within this week.

### 04-11-2018

Was not able to accomplish much today as I was busy with assignments and test preparation for Electric machines and Electronic Instrumentation.

### 05-11-2018

Started out writing the paper content for the [IIIT internship project](https://github.com/rusty-electron/smart-parking-system) paper at [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/). 

### 06-11-2018

1. Computer Vision - Udacity

Started out week-7 that deals with hough transform for detecting circles in image space.

2. GATE Preparation

So, finally after months of procastination I have started preparing for GATE. Although I have started the journey (and flexed a bit by post it here) yet the greater deal is to manage to keep it up daily or at least on alternate days.

As for now, I plan to start working on the subjects of 
* Digital Electronics
* Control Systems

We have been taught these subjects this semester so I have some idea about their core concepts (unlike subjects of previous semesters whose lessons have disappeared into the depths of my mind). Moreover, according to GATE lore these subjects are quite scoring and comparatively easy.
